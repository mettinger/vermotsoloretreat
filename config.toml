'Solo' means there is no resident teacher and the practitioner is entirely responsible for his/her schedule of practice. We believe that most retreat centers are far too expensive. Our cost is only $40 per person per day.  You may use the fully equiped kitchen to prepare your own meals or opt to have meals provided for an extra $50 per person per day.  Please note this retreat is a place for spiritual practice and philosophical reflection and is not intended for use as a vacation destination."
